It has been a little over a month, time got away from me.

## Blog improvements:

- Added RSS support
- Display tags with posts
- Clicking on a tag opens a page with related posts

## OpenAPI to Click:
- Started this project a few weeks ago, takes an OpenAPI specification and generates a command line application that can interact with that API.
- Command line app that is generated is with Python and [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/)
- This last week I added unit tests and a Github Actions pipeline to run them

## Random
- Got access to the technical preview of [GitHub Sparks](https://githubnext.com/projects/github-spark/). I've been tinkering with little projects, or "micro apps" as they call them. I found that I can't link to anything yet when I tried to create a game that other people can join. It seems to work pretty well, if a bit slow. I will share something as soon as I can.

## Watching
- Newest season of Survivor
- New show called The Summit, which is very much like Survivor but about summiting a beautiful mountain in New Zealand
- Bad Sisters
- Agatha All Along

## Reading
- Finished "The North Woods", by Daniel Mason
- Finished "Into the Woods", by Tana French, first in a series
- Started "The Morning Star", first of three books in a series
- Still working my way through "The Book of Elsewhere", by Keanu Reeves and China Mieville
