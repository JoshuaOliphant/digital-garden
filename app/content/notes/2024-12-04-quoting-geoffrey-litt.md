> And, above all: I started having more fun! When I got stuck on bugs, it felt like I was getting stuck in interesting, essential ways, not on dumb mistakes. I was able to get an intuitive grasp of my interpreterâ€™s operation, and then hone in on problems.

This is exactly how I've been feeling for the past couple of years and even more so lately. That I can use generative AI to make small, personalized tools for myself (and others) with very little effort. Tools that I never would have contemplated before because they would have been too difficult of time-consuming. Now I can focus on "essential" problems.
