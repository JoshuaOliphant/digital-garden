Bread notes 2.3.25

Tried to make the 100% whole wheat loaf. Big failure.
- Dough temperature was too high, 78 degrees after mixing
- Whole grain != whole wheat, tried the Cairsprings espresso flour but it was for to loose and elastic for the amount of water.
- Loafs ended up only a couple inches thick
- Loafs stuck to the bottom of the new bannetons.
