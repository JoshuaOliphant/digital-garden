[Andrej Karpathy - LLM Council](https://github.com/karpathy/llm-council)

> This project was 99% vibe coded as a fun Saturday hack because I wanted to explore and evaluate a number of LLMs side by side

LLM Council is a local web app that aggregates responses from multiple LLMs, lets them evaluate each other's work anonymously, then has a "Chairman" LLM synthesize the final answer. A perfect example of vibe coding - building something functional and interesting in a single session without overthinking it.
