# Demo: Panel Navigation System

This note demonstrates the new dynamic panel navigation system for the Digital Garden. When you click on internal links to other notes, they open in sliding panels to the right, allowing you to explore connected content without losing your place.

## How It Works

Click on any of these links to see the panel system in action:

- Learn about [prioritizing deep work](/notes/2025-03-16-prioritize-deep-work-over-incremental-improvement)
- Read my thoughts on [quoting Elizabeth Filips](/notes/2025-01-13-quoting-elizabeth-filips)
- Explore [building with LLMs](/notes/2024-07-18-building-with-llms-is-like-having-a-10x-junior-developer)

## Features

The panel system includes:

1. **Dynamic Opening**: Panels open to the right as you click links
2. **Fullscreen Mode**: Click the expand icon to view a panel in fullscreen
3. **Keyboard Navigation**: 
   - Use arrow keys to navigate between panels
   - Press ESC to close the current panel
4. **URL State**: Your reading path is saved in the URL, making it bookmarkable and shareable
5. **Maximum 5 Panels**: To keep things manageable, only 5 panels can be open at once

## Try It Yourself

Start by clicking any link above. Then, within that panel, click on another link to continue exploring. You'll build up a "garden walk" through the content, with each step preserved in the sliding panels.
