**What am I up to now?**

- I am currently working at ServiceNow as a Senior Systems Engineer, working on Mail and Messaging, since July 2024.
- I just published my own self-written blog a few days ago (today is 2024-09-30). It feels create to be in full control of it, and it is going to be a fun project to continue to hack on. Heavily inspired by [Maggie Appleton's concept of a Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).
- Automation, I'm trying to automate every little bit of my workflow, even if it takes longer to automate than actually do the task. Besides being fun, it has become a way to constantly put myself in the mindset of automating everything. Plus, ChatGPT makes most tasks that I wouldn't bother automating trivial.
- Taking care of the birds that live on my property.

**What are my interests?**

- Travel
- Camping, hiking, backpacking, etc.
- Sourdough baking
- Reading
- htmx
- Python
- Automation
- DevOps

My primary programming languages are Python and Java, and while I'm still better at Java than Python, I love Python much more than Java, and I'm pushing for Python to be my primary language.
