## Face Shape Identifier

An AI-powered tool that helps identify face shapes from uploaded photos.
I was looking up haircuts and how to choose the right one for my face shape, and I thought it would be fun to build a tool that could help people identify their face shapes and get personalized hairstyle recommendations.

## Markdown Link Content Scraper

This project is a web application that scrapes content from a given URL and all its linked pages, converting the content to Markdown format using the Jina API. The application shows real-time and allows users to download all scraped content as a ZIP file. The project uses FastAPI for the backend, a simple HTML/JavaScript frontend, and is containerized using uv for efficient Python dependency management.

The idea came from my use of Notebook LLM, because often I want to add a source and the sources that are linked from it. But I don't want to click through each link and get the content because it can get very tedious, particularly when there are lots of links. Now I can get all of the content as Markdown and upload it all at once to NotebookLLM.
