# Current Session - 2025-08-16

## Session ID
`session_20250816_init`

## Session Start
2025-08-16

## Session Goals
1. Initialize Claude Code knowledge management system
2. Set up project-specific configuration
3. Create context and TODO tracking
4. Establish knowledge accumulation structure

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ Analyzed project structure (Python/FastAPI with uv)
- ✅ Created .claude directory hierarchy
- ✅ Generated comprehensive PROJECT_CLAUDE.md
- ✅ Initialized TODO.md with current tasks
- ✅ Created CONTEXT.md with project state

## Session Context
This is the initialization session for the Digital Garden project. The knowledge management system has been set up to enable:
- Persistent context across Claude Code sessions
- Knowledge accumulation in patterns and decisions
- Session management with archiving
- Agent-specific configurations

## Key Insights
1. Project uses uv for Python dependency management
2. Frontend is server-rendered with HTMX for interactivity
3. Content stored as Markdown with YAML frontmatter
4. Current focus is sliding panel navigation implementation
5. Testing uses pytest with async support

## Next Steps
- Update .gitignore for privacy
- Create initial knowledge entries
- Test session persistence
- Begin work on sliding panel navigation

## Session Notes
The project is well-structured with clear separation between content, application logic, and presentation. The use of HTMX and server-side rendering is an interesting architectural choice that simplifies the frontend while maintaining interactivity.
